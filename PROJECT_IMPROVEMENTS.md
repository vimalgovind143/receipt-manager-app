# Receipt Manager App - Project Improvements Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to modernize, improve, and monetize the Receipt Manager Flutter app. Based on analysis of the existing codebase, monetization plan, and current technical state, this plan addresses technical debt, implements monetization features, and enhances user experience.

## Current State Assessment

### Technical Debt Analysis
